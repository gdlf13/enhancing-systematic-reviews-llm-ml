# Models

This folder contains the trained machine learning models and scripts for training/evaluation.

## Guidelines

- Only include model files (e.g., .pkl, .pt, .joblib) and scripts for training/evaluation.
- Document the model architecture, training procedure, and hyperparameters.
- For each model, specify the dataset and script used for training.
