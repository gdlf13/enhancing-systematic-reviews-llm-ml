# ML Training Data

This folder contains all fully anonymized datasets used for training and analysis by the machine learning models in this project.

## Guidelines

- Only include processed, anonymized data ready for ML model training or analysis.
- Document any feature engineering, preprocessing, or splits performed.
- Specify the schema and expected columns for each file.
- Document the origin and provenance of each dataset (ex: "Migrated from raw/ - ACM_health_related_dataset.csv").
