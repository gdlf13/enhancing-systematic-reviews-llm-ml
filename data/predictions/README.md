# Model Predictions

This folder contains the outputs of model predictions (e.g., *_predictions.csv) for each dataset.

## Guidelines

- Each file should clearly indicate the source dataset and model used.
- Use descriptive, snake_case file names.
- Document the structure of each output file (columns, labels, etc.).
