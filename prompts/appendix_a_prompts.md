[PROMPT 1]{.underline}

**Detailed Analysis of Prompt 1: Identifying Terms Related to Synthetic
Data**

**Prompt:** \"*Given the following information, tell what are the words
that are more related with the term synthetic data.\"*

**Purpose**

This prompt was designed to extract and identify key terms that were
closely associated with the concept of \"synthetic data\" within a
specific piece of text. The primary goal was to uncover recurring themes
and significant terms that were contextually linked to synthetic data,
which in turn could provide insights into the thematic focus of the
text. In this case, the text is an abstract was from "*Health Synthetic
Data to Enable Health Learning System and Innovation: A scoping
review",* *(Tsao et al., 2023)*.

**Methodology**

To address this prompt effectively, a systematic approach is required.
The process can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Text Processing and Tokenization:**

    -   The first step involves preprocessing the text to break it down
        into individual words or terms. This includes removing stopwords
        (common words that do not carry significant meaning, like
        \"and,\" \"the,\" \"of,\" etc.) and punctuation. Tokenization
        splits the text into its constituent words or phrases, preparing
        it for further analysis.

2.  **Term Frequency Analysis:**

    -   Once tokenized, a frequency analysis is conducted to determine
        how often each word appears in relation to \"synthetic data.\"
        This step often utilizes techniques such as Term
        Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to highlight words
        that are not just frequent but also carry significant meaning
        within the context of synthetic data.

3.  **Contextual Relevance:**

    -   Beyond frequency, the contextual relevance of each term is
        assessed. This involves examining the surrounding text to
        understand how each term relates to \"synthetic data.\" For
        example, terms like \"governance,\" \"utility,\" and \"privacy\"
        might appear frequently, but their relevance is determined by
        how they modify or interact with the concept of synthetic data
        within the abstract.

4.  **Identification of Key Terms:**

    -   The final step is to compile a list of terms that are most
        closely related to \"synthetic data\" based on their frequency
        and contextual relevance. These terms are likely to represent
        the key themes or focus areas of the text in relation to
        synthetic data.

**Application of Methodology**

Applying this methodology to the provided text, the key terms related to
\"synthetic data\" would likely include:

-   **Health Synthetic Data:** This term directly modifies \"synthetic
    data,\" specifying its application in the health sector, which is
    the primary focus of the abstract.

-   **Governance:** The abstract mentions that the governance of
    synthetic data has not been extensively studied, indicating this as
    a significant theme.

-   **Utility:** The text discusses the utility of health synthetic
    data, which is crucial for understanding its practical applications.

-   **Privacy:** Although the risk of privacy leaks is noted as low,
    privacy remains a critical issue associated with synthetic data.

-   **Data Quality:** The comparison of synthetic data quality to real
    data highlights another important aspect.

-   **Regulations and Ethics:** The abstract points out the lack of
    explicit regulations and ethical guidelines, making these key areas
    of concern.

-   **Data Sharing:** This is identified as an area with common
    principles but also noted as largely inexplicit, emphasizing its
    relevance.

**Impact**

By identifying these terms, this prompt helped to clarify the primary
focus areas of the abstract. It revealed that the discussion around
synthetic data in the studied context was heavily centered on issues of
governance, utility, privacy, data quality, and ethical considerations.
Understanding these associations was fundamental and allowed us to
pinpoint the central themes of the literature and guide the direction of
the systematic review.

This process was not just about listing terms but about understanding
the broader narrative in which synthetic data is discussed. This
analysis provided a foundation for further exploration of these themes
in the literature, ensuring that the systematic review would be designed
in a way that was both comprehensive and focused on the most relevant
aspects of synthetic data in the health domain.

**[PROMPT 2]{.underline}**

**Detailed Analysis of Prompt 2: Document Categorization Using Python**

**Prompt:** \"*Act as an expert in Python code and an expert in data
science and help me analyzing the following documents. Please look at
the uploaded documents and make a new column with the categories of the
papers. Please do it thoroughly, because it is very important for my
career.\"*

**Purpose**

This prompt was designed to automate the categorization of academic
papers based on predefined criteria. The purpose was to systematically
analyze the contents of the uploaded documents and assign each paper a
category that reflects its primary focus or theme. The categorization
process was central for organizing the data, ensuring that the
systematic review was being designed both comprehensive and
well-structured.

**Methodology**

To effectively respond to this prompt, a systematic data processing and
analysis workflow was implemented using Python. The process can be
outlined as follows:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**

    -   **Loading the Data:** The first step was to load the uploaded
        documents into a Python environment. This typically involves
        reading data from CSV, Excel, or text files using libraries such
        as Pandas. For exemple:

> ![Uma imagem com texto, Tipo de letra, captura de ecrã, Gráficos
> Descrição gerada
> automaticamente](media/image1.jpg){width="5.104166666666667in"
> height="0.6527777777777778in"}

-   **Inspecting the Data:** Once the data is loaded, it's essential to
    inspect it to understand its structure and content. This step helped
    identify the columns that would be used for categorization.

2.  **Category Definition and Assignment:**

    -   **Defining Categories:** Based on the research goals, specific
        categories needed to be defined. For example, if the review
        focuses on health-related papers, categories might include
        \"Health,\" \"Privacy,\" \"Ethics,\" and \"Governance.\"

    -   **Keyword-Based Categorization:** The simplest method to
        categorize papers was by using keyword matching. The script
        scanned the relevant columns (e.g., title, abstract) for
        keywords associated with each category. For instance:

> ![Uma imagem com texto, captura de ecrã, Tipo de letra Descrição
> gerada automaticamente](media/image2.jpg){width="5.104347112860893in"
> height="3.5833333333333335in"}

-   **Advanced Categorization Techniques:** If a more nuanced
    categorization is needed, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization combined with machine
    learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) could be
    used to predict categories based on the text.

3.  **Integration of the New Column:**

    -   **Adding the Category Column:** The next step is to add a new
        column to the dataset with the assigned categories. This is done
        by appending the results of the categorization function to the
        DataFrame.

    -   **Saving the Updated Dataset:** Finally, the updated DataFrame
        with the new \"Category\" column is saved back to a file for
        further analysis. For exemple:

> ![](media/image3.jpg){width="4.902777777777778in"
> height="0.3055555555555556in"}

4.  **Validation and Refinement:**

    -   **Manual Review:** To ensure accuracy, we manually review a
        sample of the categorized papers. This step helped in validating
        the categorization process and making any necessary adjustments
        to the script.

    -   **Iterative Refinement:** If errors or misclassifications were
        found, the script could be refined.

**Impact**

This prompt's execution was significant in structuring the dataset for
further analysis. By categorizing the papers, the systematic review
process become more organized and focused, allowing us to analyze
trends, draw connections, and synthesize findings within each category.
The thoroughness required by this prompt ensures that no relevant paper
is overlooked, and that the categorization is accurate, reliable, and
ready for in-depth analysis.

Moreover, the categorization enhances the clarity of the systematic
review, making it easier to communicate findings and supporting the
production of a high-quality, publishable article. This process is
particularly important in ensuring that the review is both comprehensive
and methodologically rigorous.

**[PROMPT 3]{.underline}**

Related\" vs \"Not Health Related\"**

**Prompt** "*Act as an experienced data scientist and python coder and
take a look at the following document.*

*I want you to look thoroughly to the columns \"MIG REVIEW\" and \"Is
health related\" and see how many papers are \"verdadeiro" (true)
(related to health) and \"falso\"(false) (not related with health).*

*Plot all of the analysis, from the number of verdadeiros vs falso,
percentage of agreement between those columns and more that you see
fit*"

**Prompt Breakdown**

The third prompt is divided into several sub-tasks, all centered around
the extraction, categorization, and visualization of articles based on
whether they are related to health or not. This series of prompts is
designed to ensure a thorough and meticulous analysis, which is crucial
for producing high-quality, reliable results.

**Purpose**

The primary goal of this prompt is to categorize articles into \"Health

oversampled data using techniques such as SMOTE*.\" (p. 1, para. 2)

Analysis: The ethical concern here is the potential over-reliance on
synthetic data for developing diagnostic models. While the synthetic
data showed better performance in the study, there\'s a risk that models
trained on synthetic data may not generalize well to real-world data.
This could lead to incorrect clinical decisions if the synthetic data
does not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios,
potentially impacting patient outcomes.

Ethical Concern: Misrepresentation of Data Quality

Quote: \"*Despite being very relevant and highly needed, using deep
generative models for synthesizing EHRs for low-resource clinical
applications is often not discussed nor motivated in most proposed
works*.\" (p. 2, para. 2)

Analysis: This quote highlights the lack of discussion around the
limitations and challenges of using synthetic data in low-resource
settings. The ethical concern is that the quality and applicability of
synthetic data in these settings may be misrepresented or overstated,
leading to misguided trust in the generated data\'s validity and its
subsequent use in clinical decision-making.

Ethical Concern: Misleading Research Conclusions

Quote: \"*The interpretability analysis showed consistency in the
ranking of the five most predictive features in the models trained on
the synthetic samples, which is reflected in the similar predictive
performance of the models trained on synthetic samples*.\" (p. 8, para.
1)

Analysis: The concern here is that the apparent consistency and
performance of models trained on synthetic data may lead researchers to
draw incorrect conclusions about the effectiveness of certain
interventions or predictive models. If the synthetic data does not
adequately represent real-world variations, it could mislead research
findings and subsequent applications in clinical settings.

Ethical Concern: Ethical Responsibility in Data Generation

Quote: \"*Our work validates the use of this synthetic data for
real-world CDSS applications of high importance in LMICS, namely
predicting HAI*.\" (p. 8, para. 2).

Analysis: This quote touches on the ethical responsibility of validating
synthetic data for critical applications like predicting
hospital-acquired infections (HAI). The ethical concern is that
inadequate validation or over-reliance on synthetic data without
rigorous testing against real-world data could lead to erroneous
predictions, thereby affecting patient care and safety.

**[PROMPT 10]{.underline}**

**Detailed Analysis of Final Prompt (Prompt 10): Ethical Considerations
of Synthetic Data Beyond Privacy**

**Prompt:** \"*I am conducting a systematic review to understand how
academic articles discuss the importance of synthetic data beyond the
perspective of privacy protection. Specifically, I am interested in
determining whether ethical concerns, according to the Belmont
Principles, are treated as a necessary consequence or as a central
concern 'by design.' I aim to identify excerpts and analyses that
address ethical considerations explicitly and in detail within the study
design. Please provide excerpts from the article that discuss synthetic
data with a focus on these ethical dimensions being ethical by design
and clarify whether these concerns are integral to the study's design or
mentioned as ancillary benefits. Give me a confidence score of your
reflection from 0 to 10. Write an assessment if it has ethical concerns
by design - yes/no. Do not include any thoughts or reflections related
to the privacy ethical concern linked to the motivation to use synthetic
data. We know that one of the main motivations to use synthetic data is
to have fewer privacy problems with data. We are looking for ethical
concerns associated with the creation of synthetic data. Be thorough,
think step by step and remember that this is very important for my
investigation and for my career*\".

**Purpose**

This prompt aimed to iterate into how academic articles address ethical
concerns related to synthetic data beyond privacy considerations,
specifically through the lens of the Belmont Principles---Respect for
Persons, Beneficence, and Justice (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 1979). The goal was to identify whether these ethical concerns
were integrated into the study design (\'ethical by design\') or merely
mentioned as ancillary benefits. The analysis excluded privacy-related
motivations and focus on other ethical dimensions associated with
synthetic data creation.
