# Prompts Used in the Study

This folder contains all prompts used for Large Language Models (LLMs), annotation tasks, and any automated or manual review steps in the project "Enhancing Systematic Reviews: Integrating LLM's, Prompt Engineering and Machine Learning for Scholarly Analysis".

## Contents

- `appendix_a_prompts.md`: Contains all prompts and instructions used for the initial screening and classification tasks.
- `appendix_b_prompts.md`: Contains prompts and templates used for advanced annotation, validation, or downstream analysis.

All prompts are provided in markdown format for transparency, versioning, and ease of reuse by other researchers.

## Usage Notes

- Prompts are versioned and described for reproducibility.
- If any prompt is updated, please document the change and its rationale.
- For each prompt, the context, intended LLM (e.g., GPT-4), and expected output should be clear in the markdown file.

## Ethical & Reproducibility Considerations

- Prompts do not contain any personal or sensitive data.
- All prompt modifications must be documented for auditability.
